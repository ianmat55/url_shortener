WHAT IS A URL SHORTENER?
A URL shortener is basically a way to make a long URL shorter. 

WHY USE ONE?
One of the most common reasons why people want a short URL is to save character space when typing messages on Twitter and other microblogging sites.

When you have a lengthy and unattractive URL on an ISP or free Web hosting service, it would look more appealing if it were shortened.Short URLs are also useful when sharing an extremely long URL over instant messaging or in email where there is a chance the long link could be broken during message transmission.

Others may want to use a short URL to hide the originating domain name when posting a URL. This can be for legitimate reasons, but unfortunately this is a feature of short URLs that is frequently abused by spammers.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
The new url link will redirect users to the original lengthy url (Look up HTTP response status code 301, 302, 307 or 308).
